# LVGL_WeatherNTime

This is a modification of the RandomNerds Tutorial https://RandomNerdTutorials.com/esp32-cyd-lvgl-weather-station/.
This version adds JSON configuration from SD storage and an NNTP time client.

Additionally, this sketch makes use of 2 timers to manage the data from the two separate sources.

This version of the sketch has also been altered for LVGL v 9.1.0
